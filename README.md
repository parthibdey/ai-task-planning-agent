description: >
    An intelligent agent that helps with task planning by breaking down natural language goals
    into actionable steps, enriching them with external information, and providing a clear
    day-by-day plan.

architecture:
  overview: "Web Interface (HTML/JS) ‚Üí Flask App ‚Üí AI Task Planning Agent ‚Üí Task Planner ‚Üí APIs & SQLite DB ‚Üí Web Plans Storage"

## How It Works

1. **Goal Input:**  
   User enters a natural language goal.

2. **Initial Planning:**  
   LLM (GPT-3.5) breaks down the goal into structured steps.

3. **Web Enrichment:**  
   Each step is enriched with relevant web search results.

4. **Weather Integration:**  
   Location-based goals receive weather forecasts.

5. **Plan Generation:**  
   Complete plan is assembled with all information.

6. **Database Storage:**  
   Plan is saved to SQLite database for future reference.

7. **Web Display:**  
   Plan is presented in a user-friendly web interface.
