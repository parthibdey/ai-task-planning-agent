description: >
    An intelligent agent that helps with task planning by breaking down natural language goals
    into actionable steps, enriching them with external information, and providing a clear
    day-by-day plan.

  - initial_planning: "LLM (GPT-3.5) breaks down the goal into structured steps."
  - web_enrichment: "Each step is enriched with relevant web search results."
  - weather_integration: "Location-based goals receive weather forecasts."
  - plan_generation: "Complete plan is assembled with all information."
  - database_storage: "Plan is saved to SQLite database for future reference."
  - web_display: "Plan is presented in a user-friendly web interface."
