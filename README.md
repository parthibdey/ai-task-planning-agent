## How It Works

1. **Goal Input:**  
   User enters a natural language goal.

2. **Initial Planning:**  
   LLM (GPT-3.5) breaks down the goal into structured steps.

3. **Web Enrichment:**  
   Each step is enriched with relevant web search results.

4. **Weather Integration:**  
   Location-based goals receive weather forecasts.

5. **Plan Generation:**  
   Complete plan is assembled with all information.

6. **Database Storage:**  
   Plan is saved to SQLite database for future reference.

7. **Web Display:**  
   Plan is presented in a user-friendly web interface.
